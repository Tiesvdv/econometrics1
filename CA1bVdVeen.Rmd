# III. Potential Outcomes
(a) Y(0,i) = Student goes to a private school
    Y(1,i) = Student goes to a public school
(b) The private college could be better aligned with the preferences of the student, allowing for more potential growth and thus higher future earnings. Higher tuition for a private college could also provide the student with more opportunities to develop themselves in varying areas, due to the higher budget this college has compared to a public college.

# IV. Causal Diagram

(a)![Causal Diagram 1](Rplot.png)

(b) 
This variation can appear through many factors that are not closely related to earnings potential. Friends going to a certain college, experiences while visiting an open day, stories from family members that went to a certain college, etc. This assumption is probably fairly realistic, although there are certain matters included in this variation that have a much larger impact on someone's final decision. But studying these effects would require a much different set of data than what is available in this set.

(c)![Causal diagram 2](Rplot2.png) Occupation could be considered a confounder, dependent on whether someone applied to a certain college to get into that occupation (which they couldn't have done if they went to a different college). What's important is that they had this occupation in mind before they selected which college they wanted to go to, and whether this choice mattered (not going to a certain college -> not getting that occupation).


(d) SAT-scores are a test of ability. This (ability) is a confounder as discussed in (a).

(a) I excluded Applicant Group B as well, since it wouldn't make sense that groups C and D are excluded but B isn't (since mixing any of those groups gives unusable results). The estimation results suggest that for this applicant group, going to a private college did not affect their future earnings.

(b) The unconditional comparison overestimates the treatment effect because it compares earnings across applicant groups.
